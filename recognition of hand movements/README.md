# Hand_mouvment-Reconnaissance
 The subject of this work concerns the design and development of shape recognition methods for the recognition of hand gestures in a video sequence. We seek to meet the design needs of a Human-Machine Interface whose objective is to transform the meaning of a hand gesture. Hand gestures are a natural and intuitive communication channel for humans to interact with their environment. They are used to designate or manipulate objects, to reinforce speech, or to communicate basically in a noisy environment. They can also represent a full-fledged language along with sign language. Gestures can have a different meaning depending on the language or culture: sign languages in particular are specific to each language.
